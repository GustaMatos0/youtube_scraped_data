## An algorithm to predict youtube views
This repository contains two notebooks: One for scrapping, the other one for predicting. The goal was to build a model able to predict the views on a youtube video using only public features, such as: channel, description, tags, title, duration and date of publishing.

To get the data yourself, run the youtube_scrap notebook. Once I scrap more data, I intend on uploading it to kaggle. I wanted to use webdriver for this project, as practice. Beacause of that, it takes quite a while to get the full dataset.

The youtube_predict notebook is where I trained models and vectorized the dataset. Be aware that, given the size of the dataset, it is very RAM consuming.

In conclusion, the best performing model was the Random Forest Regressor, with a rÂ² value of ~6.5.

For further details, refer to the prediction notebook.
